This question boils down to being able to come up with the following knowledge: uint256's maximum is 2**256â€“1, which is:

115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935

Multiplying this with 10**18, take out the last 18 digits:

115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457

Add 1, multiple this with 10**18:

115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039458000000000000000000

Which overflows to 415992086870360064, slightly below half an ether.

115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039458 and 415992086870360064 are the two key numbers to solve this challenge.
